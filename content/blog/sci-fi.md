( To write about Pantheon, Three Body Problem and Profiles of the future. Thoughts about automation and world beyond singularity)

I have been consuming a series of really good sci-fi media since the start of 2024 which got me imagining and evaluating near-future scenarios. This post will be a collection of random thoughts about situations presented by the worlds these shows/book present.

Pantheon is a show recommended by @tszzl which is based on the short stores of Ken Liu. It explores the concept of uploaded consiousness, AI cyber-security using lingo straight out of twitter (referring them as Gods). It presents the state of being digitized as THE singularity. 

The show paints a very comprehensive image of what could actually happen post achieving AGI. Work could be scaled easily by generating copies of digital beings and overclocking CPU cycles. Human, fearful at first, begin to choose to be digitzed to live in a post-scarcity world. An Adversarial arms race is spawned between nations producing their own digital beings. The UIs (Uploaded Intelligence) duke it out by invading servers, hopping to avoid a state produced digital virus.
